# Conveyor Belt Design

## Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of a conveyor belt system, with integrated motors and mechanical components to achieve the desired speed. The project includes 3D modeling and assembly in SolidWorks, as well as building and testing a scale model.

## Features

- **Motor Integration**: Designed the integration of motors with mechanical components for controlled speed.
- **3D Modeling**: Created detailed 3D models and assembly drawings using SolidWorks.
- **Scale Model**: Built and tested a scale model of the conveyor belt system.
- **Team Collaboration**: Worked closely with the team to ensure a cohesive design and successful implementation.

## Demonstration
